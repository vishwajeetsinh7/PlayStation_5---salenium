: current chrome driver give error something like "usb dissconnect" for chrome security reason so insted of chrome use firefox = loads page slow compare to chrome but it's work fine without any error (use high speed internet on firefox LIKe gigabit speed fiber connection)

why use python insted of java or javascript



A) java selenium installation take more time and it's syntax is bit more complex to remember every time you need to see java selenium documentation 


B) i don't know how to use ( refresh until button is not clickable ) in java  


C) in javascript there is option for (if element is selectable or element is enable )  but can't find place to use it.



D) in most of element selector use full xpath OR xpath  
               IF  site changes everytime it's button location use  class selector like      driver.find_element_by_class_name('button.disabled')
               
               
               
               
               for more imfo refer to very imformative selenium documantation:
               https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/

1) open main link
2) click on sign in button
3) enter username
4) enter password
5) search for buy now option avaible
6) if buy now available click 
7) else refresh page just after all element search
8) payment part
9) if purchase done print success
10) else better luck next time
